This website was created by me, Joshua Barrett. I did it all myself except the
parts I didn't do.

This website uses Cole Bemis's Feather SVG icon set. The monospace font used is
Kreative Korp's Fairfax HD, which is also used for the toki pona. The 
non-monospaced text is rendered using Kreative Korp's Constructium.

The myriad of 88x31 GIF buttons were largely found across the internet in
various archives of these badges. The textfiles.org archive is one of the larger
ones if you want to find some yourself.
