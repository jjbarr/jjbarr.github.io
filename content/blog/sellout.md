Yeah, so I have a ko-fi now. If you wanna donate, you can click the obvious link
in the lower right corner of the page. If not, that... honestly makes a ton of
sense.

Please don't give me money you can't afford to. I don't make a living doing
this, it's just what I do in my spare time. Having said that, any donations you
do give are much appreciated. 

In better news, my favicon sucks less now, I have a public email address for you
to send your flames to, and the site's CSS has just generally been
improved. I've tried to keep the page weight minimal, but I've had to actually
pull in a font, for consistency and reasons that will be explained in my next
post. Sorry about that to anyone on dial-up who tries to read my site.
