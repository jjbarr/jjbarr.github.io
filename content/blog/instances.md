One thing I heard a lot during the early days of the post-election Bluesky
explosion was Fediverse people asking when Bluesky was going to support
federation. Depending on how formal you feel about defining what "federation"
is, the answer is either
"[never](https://dustycloud.org/blog/how-decentralized-is-bluesky/)" or "[right
now](https://github.com/bluesky-social/pds)," But invariably, the question the
people asking this actually *meant* to ask was "how do you run your own
instance?"
