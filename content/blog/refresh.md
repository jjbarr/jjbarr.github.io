I love Solarized, but over time I've begun to feel like it's a bad fit for a
website. It just felt... wrong. So I changed the color scheme to
[Tomorrow](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme). If you have
Javascript enabled, you should now have the option to change between dark mode
and light mode, and if you *don't* then the theme will be chosen based on your
system preferences.

In addition, I've just generally overhauled things. Syntax highlighting now uses
the same colors as the rest of the website, there's a better homepage and a
better about page, there's a projects page where I put the things I'm interested
in, and in general I've made it so that I can show this website to people
without feeling horribly embarrassed by it.

As a rule, this site is where I put me talking about technical content, and
between college burnout and general laziness, that means it's been pretty empty
for a long time. I don't expect that to continue going forward.

(Feel free to laugh if it's been six months and there are no other posts here,
by the way. That's funny.)
