[So you're me and you're in compilers
class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdyociU35u8) and you're supposed to be
learning about infix expression parsing but you're not interested in your
teacher once again talking about how the Shunting Yard Algorithm works, because
you've got a D&D game tonight and you haven't made a character yet. Fortunately
for you, Google has a built-in dice roller that you can use instead of rolling
dice at your desk, which would obviously get you caught.
