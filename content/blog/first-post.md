Welcome to the first post on this very shiny new blog. I'm finally happy with
the design after a few hours tweaking it. It's elegant, minimalist, and it feels
pretty good! Mmmm... minimalism. I like minimalism. If this site ever requires
Javascript, please punch me in the chest.

Anyways, moving on, you might be wondering what you can expect from this blog in
the future. That's a good question. If I were you, I wouldn't expect any sort of
regular or consistent schedule, but you should expect interesting and irrelevant
technical asides from a person with no formal qualifications, because that's
what most of this will be. Just... imagine some weird guy screaming at the sky
outside. Now imagine that person used Emacs and really hated C++ and XML to an
almost irrational degree. If that person had a blog, it might look a bit like
this website.

If that sounds good to you, you can subscribe to my newsfeed. Yes, those are
still a thing.
