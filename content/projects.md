Here are a few little things I've done. If you have extremely specific
interests, some of these things might relevant to you.

- [elf2psx](https://github.com/jjbarr/elf2psx) (2023): A tool for translating ELF
  binaries into Playstation 1 executables. There are many such tools, but I like
  to think that mine is a little bit nicer to use than most of them (although
  it could be better documented).
- [blinkenlights](https://github.com/jjbarr/blinkenlights) (2021): Scrapped
  together for a makerspace demo with a bit of circuitpython and a touch of
  BPFTrace (I tried to get it working with DTrace as well, but I don't think
  that came together...), this was written to render per-CPU core utilization
  (well, thread utilization really) onto twelve strips of
  conveniently-accessible neopixels, inspired by ye olde [BeBox front
  panels](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Samsung_SyncMaster_191T_and_BeBox_20081114.jpg).
  I think the utilization monitoring technique I used is somewhat questionable,
  but the visualization still looked pretty cool and it might be of use if you
  want to make something similar.
- [megutil](https://github.com/jjbarr/megutil) (2020): In the far-off year of
  2020, Command & Conquer Remastered had just come out and I wanted to take a
  look at the game's assets. While there were tools that could extract files
  from the proprietary archive format that game used, they were all windows
  only, and I wanted something nice and convenient and Linux-friendly. So I
  wrote something.
