Hello!

My name is Joshua Barrett, and I'm a computer science undergraduate at the
University of Massachusetts Amherst who is interested in systems programming
and numerous other curious and arcane subjects. I use this site for blog posts
about things I find interesting, and more or less whatever else I care to dump
here. If you saw something interesting on this site that you want to contact me
about... well, I'll figure something out eventually so you can do that without
me giving out my private e-mail address. For now, you're probably out of
luck. Sorry about that.

No social media address either, sorry. I don't believe in social media.
