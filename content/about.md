My name is Joshua Barrett and I'm a recent computer science graduate. I have
long been fascinated by how software works and how it interacts with hardware,
so that's what I tend to write about here: software at least one degree of
separation from the programs that you directly interact with on a computer.

If you want to contact me, you should find email or any other relevant form of
public contact at the bottom right of your screen, by the RSS feed link.
