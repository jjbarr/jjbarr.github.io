Hello!

My name is Joshua Barrett, and I'm a computer science undergraduate at the
University of Massachusetts Amherst who is interested in systems programming and
numerous other curious and arcane subjects. I use this site for blog posts about
things I find interesting, and more or less whatever else I care to dump
here. If you saw something interesting on this site that you want to contact me
about, you can click the email icon in the right corner and mail me. If you'd
like to support this nonsense, you can click the dollar sign, also in the right
corner, to donate money.
